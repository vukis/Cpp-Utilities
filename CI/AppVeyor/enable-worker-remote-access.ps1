#
# Enable access to the build worker via Remote Desktop
#

#
# Usage:
#
#  enable-worker-remote-access.ps1 [-block|-check_for_block]
#
#
# Calling this script will enable and display the Remote Desktop
# connection details. By default, the connection will be available
# for the length of the build.
#
# Specifying ``-block`` option will ensure the connection remains
# open for at least 60 mins.
#
# Specifying ```-check_for_block`` option will keep the connection
# open only if the environment variable ``BLOCK`` has been set to ``1``.
